# Thinking in React

The React approach to building apps:

1. Break the user interface into components
2. Describe the different visual states for each component
3. Connect the components together to allow data to flow through them.


To accomplish this, you should start with some JSON API data (can be dummy data to start) and, hopefully a mockup.  Then follow these 5 steps:

### 1. Break the UI into a component heirarchy

### 2. Build a static version in React

### 3. Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state

### 4. Identify where your state should live

### 5. Add inverse data flow
